Software engineering is a disciplined way of developing a software with the exact time, cost and requirement to solve a problem . So software process are the ways or the steps that to be followed to produce the exact software product. This well defined process will show the quality of our product. There are some common steps for software process. Communication ,hereby communicating with the client we will get the details of the products. The requirement collection and specification of the software producats are done at this level.Planning, here a well structured planning will be done for developing modelling construction and deployment are other phases of software process.Software process has an important role in our day to day life .Actually it is not an good idea to develop a software without moving step by  step.Each step contribute to a large extend to develop a software . Because at each phase we are really modifying our product . First we will collect the requirements from the client then after proper planning the unscientific parts are removed. Then we will modify our inference then we will construct our product .Last is deployment. So on all these software technique process we are building a product without the steps by step development we may not be able to complete our software at the right schedule.
